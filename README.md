Electric Machines - Magnetic Equivalent Circuit (Version 1)

This is an Electric Machine Simulation Tool based on the Magnetic Equivalent Circuit or Reluctance Network.

Currently it is possible to perform both:
  -> time-harmonic (AC-magnetostatics) magnetic field analysis;
  -> time-step (transient) magnetic field analysis.

Electric circuit components supported:
  -> coil (electric circuit/MEC linking component through back-EMF source);
  -> inductor;
  -> resitance;
  -> capacitor;
  -> voltage source;
  -> current source.

In the example.h/.cpp files you will find several examples of electric machine simulation applications, comprising transformers, synchronous reluctance machine, and synchronous permanent magnet machine.
