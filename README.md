Electric Machines - Magnetic Equivalent Circuit

This is a Electric Machine simulation tool based on magnetic equivalent circuit or reluctance network.

Currently it is possible to simulate static machines (transformers), induction machines, and synchronous reluctance machines through sinusoidal AC magnetostatics analysis, and any magnetic device through magnetodynamics (time-step) analysis. Electric circuit components supported: impedances (AC magnetostatics only), coils, inductors, resitances, voltage sources, current sources.
